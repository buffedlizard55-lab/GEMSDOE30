# GEMSDOE30 — DOE GEMS fault-discovery research

> **Persistent project brief — read this section before every project session.** This is the durable, de-duplicated form of the original project prompt: repeated paragraphs are consolidated, while its scientific, operational, and integrity requirements are retained. Keep `docs/score-ledger.csv`, `docs/irregularities.md`, and the linked official sources in sync when updating claims.

## Mission and non-negotiable requirements

1. **Objective:** build an auditable, scientifically grounded workflow to identify previously unmapped geological faults in the DOE GEMS / GeoDAWN region and compete for a top leaderboard position. The public leaderboard is feedback, not the private test set or the final award decision. Never promise a score or prize.
2. **Metric-aware learning:** the official public metric is a distance-weighted Tversky index with a triangular 300 m support kernel on 100 m pixels, `alpha=0.2`, `beta=0.8`. Prefer training objectives that represent this geometry. Pair any distance/boundary term with a regional loss; compare them under a spatially blocked holdout and report how their near-miss behavior changes. A synthetic unit probe is not a real holdout result.
3. **Submission first:** when a scientifically promoted candidate exists, make a single-band float32 GeoTIFF with probabilities in `[0,1]`, on the exact sample-template CRS, shape, bounds, and transform; put null/NaN only outside the valid footprint. Check for NaN/Inf *inside* the footprint, which can trigger the portal's “Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]” error. Make the download and the submission instructions obvious at the top of the site. Give every run a unique filename and a short paste-ready submission note.
4. **No slot without evidence:** pre-register 3–5 genuinely distinct geological hypotheses. Each must state the exact layers, physical signature, why it could indicate a fault absent from USGS/INGENIOUS, what makes it different from prior work, likely DTI change and cost, official data source/license/access status, and a falsifiable holdout gate. Validate the leading candidate against the current spatial-holdout best, with confirmation, before spending a weekly submission slot. No holdout pass means no slot.
5. **Research and provenance:** use free, publicly accessible, official or otherwise authoritative data where allowed. Store a clean source table, exact citations/URLs, access and licensing checks, experiment protocols, results, and irregularities. Distinguish official facts from user-supplied claims, owner-mirror evidence, hypotheses, and model estimates. Never invent a score, source, file hash, access result, or holdout result.
6. **Competition integrity:** respect the rules and source terms. Do not bypass the DrivenData login, collect or store account credentials, submit files, or consume competition slots on the user's behalf. Public leaderboard values are time-stamped snapshots; do not build a robot/spider that monitors DrivenData.
7. **Autonomous execution and accountability:** complete what can be done without asking for manual input; identify hard blockers rather than disguising them. Review work in three cumulative passes: implement and verify; inspect bugs/edge cases; re-check against this brief and fix. Flag every unresolved irregularity.
8. **Core values:** **Maximize P(Win)** by choosing evidence-driven work with a plausible path to generalization, not by chasing attractive but unverified claims. **Own the Outcome** end-to-end: record failures, fix defects, keep the user-facing path usable, and state what remains blocked.
9. **Project governance:** use this repository as the research and submission-tooling home. Keep private/large competition data and generated rasters out of Git. The final competition entry must satisfy all eligibility, documentation, AI-disclosure, and submission rules; confirm current requirements with the organizer when ambiguous.

## Current verified state — 2026-10-03

- This checkout began with **only a README**: no model, tests, training scripts, datasets, sample template, generated TIFF, or previous pipeline were present. Earlier claims that this checkout already had `scripts/download_competition_data.sh`, `scripts/prepare_data.py`, and a ready train/inference/validation pipeline were not true at the starting commit; this repository now contains an auditable scaffold, but real-data training is still blocked.
- The DrivenData data page redirects an unauthenticated visitor to its login page. No DrivenData credentials/session or competition rasters are available here, and the shell cannot retrieve the public owner-mirror TIFFs in this environment. The safe data preflight is `bash scripts/download_competition_data.sh`; it reports missing inputs and does **not** attempt a login bypass.
- The official leaderboard was read on **2026-10-03**: the displayed leader was **DARD, 0.3195**. It is a live, changeable public score; it is not private-test performance. The supplied claim that the linked GEMSDOE25 D2.8 TIFF scored 0.2600 is **not authenticated to that exact file**: the GEMSDOE25 landing page currently describes that TIFF as unscored/not slot-approved, while the public leaderboard contains a 0.2600 row for participant `wbg1` at rank 15. See [analysis](docs/leaderboard-analysis.md) and [irregularities](docs/irregularities.md).
- The 300 m loss geometry and spatial-holdout evaluation code are implemented. The unit suite passes with the optional geospatial/training stack, and a disposable synthetic 64×64 pipeline smoke passed through preparation, paired four-fold training/inference, provenance-checked OOF stitching/evaluation, full fit, TIFF writing, and template validation. The separate translation probe verifies the intended 100 m/200 m near-miss ordering. **These are software/synthetic checks only. No real spatial holdout has run, no score gain is claimed, and no new GEMSDOE30 TIFF has been produced.**
- The site exposes a one-click link to the pre-existing GEMSDOE25 research TIFF, clearly labeled external, unscored, and not slot-approved. It is not represented as this repository's model output or as an approved competition submission. A genuine GEMSDOE30 download will be generated only after data placement, training, holdout promotion, and exact-template validation.

## Start here

1. Read the [executive summary and submission guide](executive-summary.html).
2. Read the styled [leaderboard/file attribution analysis](docs/leaderboard-analysis.html), [ranked hypotheses](docs/hypotheses.html), [loss design](docs/loss-design.html), and [irregularity register](docs/irregularities.html).
3. Review the styled [official/primary source register](docs/sources.html); full claim-by-claim notes remain in `docs/sources.md`.
4. Install the optional geospatial/training stack and run the test suite (optional geospatial and loss-gradient tests run when their dependencies are installed):

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -e '.[train,test]'
   python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
   python scripts/loss_geometry_probe.py
   ```

5. Place the competition files, downloaded through an authorized competition session, in `data/raw/` as `training_features.tif`, `labels.tif`, and `sample_submission.tif`. Then run:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/download_competition_data.sh
   python scripts/prepare_data.py
   ```

   The preparation script fails closed on CRS, transform, shape, label encoding, or footprint mismatch. It writes raw features and masks under the Git-ignored `data/processed/`; each training run fits and stores its own robust normalization statistics using training-fold pixels only, never held-out pixels.

6. Run the *paired* loss experiment on all four buffered spatial folds with the same seed and optimization settings in both arms. For each fold `F` in `0 1 2 3`, run:

   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py --fold F --loss regional --output runs/fF-regional.pt
   python scripts/train_model.py --fold F --loss combined --output runs/fF-combined.pt
   python scripts/infer_model.py --checkpoint runs/fF-regional.pt --fold F --predictions-only --output runs/fF-regional.npy
   python scripts/infer_model.py --checkpoint runs/fF-combined.pt --fold F --predictions-only --output runs/fF-combined.npy
   ```

   Keep each inference `.json` sidecar beside its `.npy`. The stitcher requires the same prepared-grid signature and identical training recipe across the four folds, as well as held-out-only masks, before it creates an OOF mosaic. Then compare both arms with the exact metric and near-miss diagnostics:

   ```bash
   python scripts/stitch_oof_predictions.py --fold0 runs/f0-regional.npy --fold1 runs/f1-regional.npy --fold2 runs/f2-regional.npy --fold3 runs/f3-regional.npy --output runs/regional-oof.npy
   python scripts/stitch_oof_predictions.py --fold0 runs/f0-combined.npy --fold1 runs/f1-combined.npy --fold2 runs/f2-combined.npy --fold3 runs/f3-combined.npy --output runs/combined-oof.npy
   python scripts/evaluate_loss_ablation.py --regional runs/regional-oof.npy --combined runs/combined-oof.npy
   ```

   Repeat the complete paired design with preregistered fresh seeds for confirmation. Do not treat one fold or the synthetic probe as confirmation.

7. Only after a candidate clears the frozen holdout and confirmation gates should it be fit on all permitted training labels. `scripts/infer_model.py` or `scripts/build_submission.py` writes a uniquely named, template-matched TIFF and a JSON sidecar. `scripts/validate_submission.py FILE.tif --template data/raw/sample_submission.tif` must pass before any human upload.

## Current next steps and limits

1. Obtain the authorized competition package and template, then verify byte-level provenance and feature/label semantics. This is the current hard blocker to real training/holdout testing.
2. Run the registered regional-vs-boundary ablation on spatial blocks; report all folds, seeds, pooled DTI, near-miss histograms, and failure cases. The 0.5 geometry weight is an initial test setting, not a tuned or established optimum.
3. Test the leading geothermal-evidence hypothesis only if its exact GDR archives are downloaded, checksummed, licensed, aligned, and separately ablated. Catalog-page visibility is not proof that a ZIP has been retrieved.
4. Build and validate an exact-grid TIFF only from a promoted model. No artifact can be honestly produced from this checkout today because its competition template and prediction inputs are absent.
5. Refresh the leaderboard snapshot by a permitted method. DrivenData's Terms of Use prohibit robots/spiders/automatic access for monitoring or copying, so this project does not scrape it; this limitation prevents an autonomous continuously updated leaderboard feed. The official site remains the manual source of live values.
6. Confirm any deadline discrepancy in the competition homepage versus the September 2026 rules PDF with the organizer; see [irregularities](docs/irregularities.md).
