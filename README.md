# GEMSDOE30 — GEMS concealed-fault research

> **SESSION MISSION (read every session):** Place top of the DOE GEMS concealed-fault leaderboard by generating a **unique** single-band `float32` `[0,1]` GeoTIFF submission (EPSG:32611, 3730×3292, 100 m, `sample_submission.tif` grid, `NaN` outside the footprint) that is obvious to download and obvious whether it is OK to submit. Core values: **Maximize P(Win)** and **Own the Outcome**. Never copy a previous submission as your own; never submit a candidate that has not beaten the holdout best with a paired 95% CI lower bound > 0; protect the 3-per-week DrivenData slot. The full operating protocol is in the `#current-owner-prompt` section below — reread it before changing code. The current-session addendum requires 3–5 explicitly differentiated geological hypotheses, source/access checks, a same-protocol blocked holdout before slot consideration, repeated code/site review, and no score projections presented as results; see [the dated review](docs/research/2026-10-27-current-session-review.md). A prior duplicate-stop and lane/budget restriction overrides the aspiration to generate a TIFF whenever its gates fail.

## Follow-up safety review · 2026-10-28: off-lattice generation disabled

**[Review the stopped generation path](offlattice-safety-review.html).** The archived
`build_offlattice_submission.py` selected every lattice coverage hole regardless
of geological weights. It bypassed the existing no-evasion restriction and had
no holdout result. It now exits 2 without writing files, fetching data or fitting
a model. Historical evidence is unchanged. No new TIFF, score estimate or slot.
See [three-pass review and full restoration commands](docs/research/2026-10-28-offlattice-safety-review.md)
and [negative run card](docs/research/2026-10-28-offlattice-safety-run-card.json).
The nine-site audit's `--restore-only` needs the template and lattice restored
separately first; it only restores the nine historical files.

## Latest repository audit · 2026-10-28: **NO APPROVED SUBMISSION DOWNLOAD**

The current owner prompt below remains the operating brief, including the unique-TIFF requirement, three-experiment/two-hour cap, Core Values and separate slot selector. This session supplies no single method paragraph assigning a new lane. We must not bypass the existing duplicate stop to satisfy the download aspiration.

**[Open the nine-site executive byte audit](priority-readiness-audit.html)** — it reopens the exact historical leaders from all nine requested sites and now measures actual final-dot overlap against the pinned lattice, instead of only reporting budget bounds. All nine exceed **99.90%** overlap and fail the literal uniqueness rule. Five pass the shared published-format validator; four fail its outside-footprint null convention. Format validity does not establish competitiveness or portal acceptance. There is no new model, TIFF, score estimate, submission name/note, or weekly-slot selection. The old historical scores, including H33-B2's owner-reported 0.2778, are **not organizer-confirmed receipts**.

After installing the research/test extras in a virtual environment and restoring the template/lattice using the commands below:

```bash
python scripts/audit_priority_readiness.py --restore-only  # pinned historical inputs; no receipts overwritten
python scripts/audit_priority_readiness.py --check         # offline remeasurement; no approval or selector
```

CI and the GitHub-only status refresh run this audit automatically. The nine local per-site summary pages link to it; **other repositories and their deployed websites were not modified**. Source links are audit references, not recommended competition uploads. A negative result is a deliverable, not permission to generate a renamed or perturbed old raster.

## Current scientific decision · 2026-10-27: **DUPLICATE-STOP · DO NOT SUBMIT**

**This audit made no new model, TIFF, submission name, note, or weekly-slot selection.**
The pinned [13GEMSDOE lattice](https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/13GEMSDOE/blob/92ee6f074323f161eed837b80ec3ee5b662e26f5/docs/downloads/13gems_20261001_r13-lattice-s5_v2_nan-outside.tif)
covers all but 6,649 of 5,167,373 valid footprint cells within 3 pixels. Any
44,090-dot candidate must overlap it by at least **37,441/44,090 = 84.9195%**,
above the literal >70% stop. The previously published CSR-1 TIFF actually
matches **44,084/44,090 = 99.9864%**. Its older 357-raster screen did not
include this reference. A bound that does not prove a stop (budgets below
22,164) is **not a novelty pass**; do not change the budget merely to evade it.
Two files merged concurrently in PR #54 are also stopped: CTD-1 overlaps the
lattice at **39,984/40,000 (99.9600%)**, and FC-1 at **10,844/10,848 (99.9631%)**.
Their published-format checks pass, but their archived holdout used predictions
built from the full catalogue before hiding faults; it is not a leakage-safe
comparison. Their original generation and scoring commands now fail closed.

### Upstream research artifacts (PRs #58/#59; both gate-stopped)
Two TIFFs arrived from upstream PRs #58/#59; this review generated neither. The geothermal-corridor artifact is `docs/downloads/GEMSDOE30-geothermal-corridor-offcat-d3-20261027T233111Z.tif` (SHA-256 `0ed2670200159cab23436a5033a90d7582accc63811756d3393441c6bbdac564`). It passes the published-format checks (EPSG:32611, 3730×3292, float32 [0,1] in-footprint, NaN outside), but **39,960/40,000 dots (99.9%)** fall within 3 px of the pinned lattice. Its catalogue-proxy **HOLDOUT-DTI 0.073314** [0.063811, 0.082800], 60,988 withheld positives, evaluator `component-holdout-v3-blockstats-20261025`, is not an organizer score or leaderboard forecast and is not comparable to the current same-protocol best. The vent-structural artifact (`docs/downloads/GEMSDOE30-vent-structural-offcat-d3-20261027T000000Z.tif`, SHA-256 `e701076a93df45ae911b15519bcce66d88cca318686fa39df4117e921dd1876b`) also passes published-format checks, but **37,654/37,654 dots (100%)** fall within 3 px of the lattice; no verified HOLDOUT-DTI receipt was found. Both fail the duplicate rule; the pre-placement surfaces are unavailable for this review. Their separate whole-array finite-range diagnostics fail because outside-footprint values are NaN. **Neither is approved to download or submit.** See the current review and run card for the hash-bound audit.

The historical CSR-1 file is [available for research only](docs/downloads/gems30-CSR1-44090-20261026-502fb5948335-zeros.tif)
(SHA-256 `0fbf3b4a47c2229b68de59e174617f3b47973613ff57950712d25b9166c1d900`).
It also **fails the published-format validator** because the outside-footprint
cells are zeros; its whole-array finite [0,1] diagnostic passes. Neither local
result establishes portal acceptance or diagnoses the user's prior range error.
**Do not upload this or any renamed/re-encoded historical file.**

The historical mapped-catalogue proxy was **HOLDOUT-DTI 0.158162 [0.144986,
0.171474]** versus same-run `msdb_edge` **0.169986 [0.156534, 0.183948]**;
evaluator `component-holdout-v3-blockstats-20261025`, 60,988 withheld positives.
The post-hoc positive fold is exploratory, not a confirmed breakthrough. No
organizer-confirmed artifact score or defensible leaderboard forecast is available.
The nine-site historical owner reports are unverified, not measured scores.

**Deadline discrepancy:** the competition page listed 3 Dec 2026 at 23:59 UTC,
while the official rules PDF Appendix A.1 says 5 p.m. ET (22:00 UTC that day).
Confirm with the organizer and plan for the earlier time. The rules allow up to
three feedback submissions per week and require one final selection for both rounds.

### Reproduce the current stop

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[research,test]' -c requirements-tdx1.txt
python scripts/restore_public_mirrors.py --ids sample_submission
python scripts/restore_public_mirrors.py --pins docs/research/2026-10-27-registry-preflight/lattice-pin.json --ids registry_lattice
python scripts/verify_registry_preflight.py       # exit 0 verifies a negative
python scripts/verify_registry_preflight.py --require-promote  # exit 2
python scripts/build_research_site.py --check
python -m pytest -q
```

The source mirrors are SHA-pinned, not organizer-authenticated. The preflight is
not a complete registry or proof of geological equivalence; one witness suffices
to stop. A future attempt requires an explicit assigned lane, appropriate
registry policy, leakage-safe blocked holdout, fresh two-stage novelty checks,
exact saved-byte validation, and separate selector approval. DrivenData's
[terms](https://www.drivendata.org/termsofuse/) restrict automated access and
monitoring; the repository's status refresh is GitHub-only and does not scrape
the [organizer leaderboard](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/).

Historical CSR, QPC, GDX and other receipts are retained under `docs/research/`;
older claims and download permissions are superseded, not silently rewritten.

## Parallel lane 2026-10-27 — POOL-1: **MECHANISM CONFIRMED · RASTER DUPLICATE-STOPPED · DO NOT SUBMIT**

POOL-1 ran in parallel with the registry preflight above, under its own frozen
preregistration/registry (394 dotted-submission rasters from 2026-10-27 HEAD clones of
GEMSDOE24/25/27/28/30/31/32/33/36; dense calibration parents reported separately; the
13GEMSDOE lattice witness and CTD-1/FC-1 postdate its registry freeze — coverage of
those is UNKNOWN, see `docs/research/2026-10-27-pool/postmerge-addendum.json`; under the
preflight's literal lattice bound every ≥22,164-dot candidate is stopped regardless).

- **Science (HOLDOUT-DTI, `component-holdout-v3-blockstats-20261025`, 60,988 withheld):**
  pooled 75-feature HGB (13 raw + MSDB-18 + CSR-27 + LiDAR-17 — first lane to pool
  MSDB-18 with CSR-27) scored **0.186699** (seed 4201) and **0.187694** (seed 4219) vs
  same-protocol `msdb_edge` 0.169468/0.174247: Δ **+0.017231 [+0.010515, +0.023980]** and
  **+0.013446 [+0.006993, +0.019757]**, 4/4 folds both seeds, 0/324 canary alarms.
  Catalogue-recovery evidence only — not a leaderboard score or projection.
- **Artifact: DUPLICATE-STOP, no TIFF published.** Final dots: 88.74% within 3 px of
  FFL1, 75.81% of MSDB1-edge, 71.08% of CSR1 (gate 70%); surface ρ ≤ 0.1366 passed;
  format 12/12 on the quarantined raster (ignored `runs/pool1/`, sha256 `1d9cab5d…`).
  Experiments 3/3. Verify: `.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_pool_run.py` (exit 0;
  `--require-promote` exit 2). Never perturb/rescue the stopped raster.
- **Nine-site finding (re-verified pixel-exactly 2026-10-27):** the historical leaders
  are one h19-5 emission family — GEMSDOE25 = GEMSDOE30 and GEMSDOE28 = GEMSDOE31
  identical; H33-B2 (0.2778 owner-reported) = D2.8 minus exactly the ≤2 px

Review the repo.

I want to focus on the highest scoring submissions from the following sites, GEMSDOE24, GEMSDOE25, GEMSDOE27, GEMSDOE28, GEMSDOE30, GEMSDOE31, GEMSDOE32, GEMSDOE33, GEMSDOE36.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE HIGHEST URGENCY AND MUST BE FOLLOWED!

MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION FOR THE COMPETITION. DO NOT COPY A PREVIOUS SUBMISSION UNLESS IT'S FOR LEARNING AND EDUCATION. BUT WE MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION. IT MUST BE OBVIOUS WHETHER IT IS OK TO DOWNLOAD AND SUBMIT THE GENERATED TIF SUBMISSION.

There should be an easy to download submission tif file as described by the prompt. Read the entire prompt. A lot of sites mention inspection only and a human inspector, but the inspection needs to be done through the project and needs to be validated for submission without human intervention.

PARALLEL-RUN PROTOCOL — read first. This session is one of several running from this same prompt.

1. LANE. Your lane is the single method paragraph below. Stay inside it. If your raster's rank-correlation with any registry raster exceeds [0.90], or more than [70%] of your dots fall within 3 px of one registry raster's dots, you have drifted into another lane: log it as a duplicate and stop. Check this on the surface before placement AND on the final dots.

2. REUSE, DON'T REBUILD. Use the template's cached feature stack, evaluate_holdout.py and submission_writer.py. Holdout = hide-and-recover: withhold whole fault segments with a buffer, derive every catalogue-based feature only from the visible faults, mask visible faults pixel-exactly, score pooled DTI (alpha 0.2, beta 0.8, 300 m triangular kernel). If a shared tool is wrong, fix it once in the template and report it; never keep a private fork.

3. LABEL EVERY NUMBER as HOLDOUT-DTI (evaluator version, number of withheld positives, 95% CI) or ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED (copied from a submission-page receipt). A projection is never written as a score.

4. LEAKAGE CANARY. Test each feature alone on the holdout before trusting any result. AUC above [0.90] means leakage until proven otherwise.

5. RUN CARD. End with one JSON card: hypothesis; mechanism; the named non-fault process that could mimic it; holdout DTI + CI; correlation/overlap vs registry; raster sha256; validator output (no NaN inside the footprint, values in [0,1], CRS/shape/transform match); submission name + note of at most 140 characters; verdict promote / negative. Negative results are deliverables.

6. BUDGET. Stop after [3] experiments or [2] hours. Do not pick submissions: promotion to a real slot is a separate selector step, within the weekly cap shown on the submission page.

The following sites should serve as a starting point for understanding how to generate TIF submissions. These websites are researched, and tested and have generated TIF submissions. But we need to generate high scoring submissions.

Here are the results from submissions into the competition, separated by ....:

WE NEED TO STUDY, ANALYZE, AND UNDERSTAND THE HIGHEST SCORE FROM THE GEMDOE SITE WHERE THE SUBMISSION TIF IS DOWNLOADED FROM WHICH IS THE FOLLOWING:

Why and how did this get the highest score and are we able to generate a submission that scores higher than 0.2778?

Answer the question using Phd level experience, knowledge, and judgement. Then use the answer to generate a unique TIF submission into the competition. Must be unique submission unlike any within the GEMSDOE sites above. Verify working line by line no hallucinations.

I think it makes sense that in order for a submission to be validated that it needs to pass certain high scoring validation gates before confirming whether a file is unique and can be submitted for scoring.

The following is the leaderboard for the competition:

https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/

See below for more links and information related to the competition:

https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution
https://www.usgs.gov/data/geodawn-airborne-magnetic-and-radiometric-surveys-northwestern-great-basin-nevada-and
https://gbcge.org/current-projects/ingenious/
https://epsg.io/32611
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tversky_index

We need to quickly look at the results and results from the GEMSDOE websites above.

Before implementing, generate 3–5 candidate geological hypotheses we haven't tried yet, each naming: the specific layer(s) involved, the physical signature being targeted (e.g., an edge-detection or curvature transform), why it should catch a fault missing from the USGS/INGENIOUS catalogue rather than one already in it, and how it differs from anything already implemented in this repo. Rank them by expected DTI improvement and implementation cost. Validate the top candidate on our spatially-blocked holdout set before touching a weekly submission slot — do not spend a submission slot on an idea that hasn't beaten the current holdout best. If a candidate can't be validated without new external data, name the specific free, official source needed and check it's obtainable before proposing the idea as viable.

Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review. There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks. Flag any irregularities for review. No hallucinations.

Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements. No hallucinations. Verify line by line.

We have a good understanding of how our hypothesis, methodology, calculations, analysis are done so we should be able to figure out a way to score higher on the leaderboard using previous results and scoring that we have across the sites listed above. We need to come up with distinct and unique strategies to score higher in this competition leaderboard. We need to start doing heavy and deep research into the part of the project that matters the most, which is the scientific discovery of geothermal vents. We should store all of our information and knowledge that we can gather from official verified sources. This will serve as a starting point for other projects as well. We need to think outside the box but still be grounded in proper scientific research, we are ultimately aiming for a top prize that many others are competing for. So it's important to be contrarian but be smart about it. We need to find sources of data that others are over looking or areas of the project when it comes to geothermal vents. We need to do deep research and critical thinking and come up with new hypothesis to test.

0.3195 is the highest score right now so we need to design a new strategy, research, testing, analyzing, and generating submission system than the current website. It should be unique, take unique approaches to generating a submission that can score higher than 0.3195.

Put this prompt into the repo readme and read it everytime we work on the project as a starting point to make sure we are building what we are aiming for and have a strong base to continue building and improving on making something useful for everyday use. It should solve the problem of having to manually check everything ourselves and having an up to date current feed.

Review the repo.

The following is taken from the Arena AI team and I think it makes a good point on building a successful project, so let's keep the Core Values and Own the Outcome as a focal point when building, developing, researching, suggesting upgrades, and implementing the work.

Our Core Values

Maximize P(Win)

“Maximize the Probability of Winning”: our decision making framework. In every decision, we weigh tradeoffs, assess risk, and choose the path that maximizes the probability that Arena succeeds. We set aside our emotions and make tough decisions in order to maximize P(Win). “Maximize P(Win)” frees us from constraints and clarifies that we must put Arena first.

Own the Outcome

We own results end to end — not just our individual slice of the work. When problems arise and we have the means to act, we do so without waiting for permission or assignment. We treat failure and success as signals and use them to improve. At Arena, we stay accountable to the final outcome.

Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review. There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks. Flag any irregularities for review. No hallucinations.

Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements. No hallucinations. Verify line by line.

We need to focus on being able to generate a submission into the competition.

The site should be able to generate a TIF file that is required for submission. It should be as easy as download to click a File to submit into the competition. This needs to be in the executive summary or the very beginning of the site. it should be obvious when you visit the site.

I tried to submit the document that i downloaded from the site but it returned this error on the submission form:

"Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]"

Also we need to give it a unique name and A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Here is the submission page when i click submit file

New submission

File to submitNo file chosen

You can submit a single-band GeoTIFF (.tif) file, or a .zip file containing a single GeoTIFF, with your predictions. It must match the submission format's CRS, shape, and geotransform. You may wish to review the competition rules first.

Note (optional)

A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Create a executive summary subpage that explains exactly how to make a submission into the contest.

Work on the next steps from the previous sessions first.

The goal of this project is to place top of the leaderboard in this competition. The following is the competition:

https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/

We need to create a project that can compete and place top of the leaderboard. We need to understand the problem, collect all the data and organize it into a clean easily auditable table with official verified links for manual verification.

This is the guidelines we need to follow.https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/

Get familiar with the problem through the overview and problem description,https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/. You might also want to reference additional resources available on the about page,https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/968/.

Download the data from the data,https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/data/, tab.

Create and train your own model. This reference solution,https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution implements a simple approach.

Use your model to generate predictions that match the submission format.

Tell me what are you limitations and what you need access to during this project. We will need to find free publicly available sources and data from official and verified sources if we are to use 3rd party or external data.

this pdf outlines how submissions must be entered into the competition.

https://docs.nlr.gov/docs/fy26osti/96647.pdf

You must be able to do your own research, deep research, scientific literature research and organize the knowledge so that we can critically think through the problem and generate a solution through scientific and free publicly available information. this must be done autonomously and must be constantly reviewed and improved upon. Provide suggestions and improvements and implement them.

Site creation

Create a github page for this repo that has clean ui, user friendly, simple and easy to use. It should be organized and clean.

It should include all relevant information in an easy to read format with official verified links as sources for review. Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.

**The single remaining blocker to training is data placement**: run `bash scripts/download_competition_data.sh` on any unrestricted machine into `data/`, then `python scripts/prepare_data.py` — after that the full train→inference→validate pipeline is ready to run (GPU needed for training; metric/losses/validation all verified working here on CPU).

you need to complete the above task by yourself. Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review. There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks. Flag any irregularities for review. No hallucinations.

Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements. No hallucinations. Verify line by line.

Run this task through multiple passes.

Pass 1: Implement the task completely and verify the result.

Pass 2: Review your work for bugs, missing requirements, incorrect assumptions, and edge cases. Fix everything you find.

Pass 3: Re-check the entire implementation against the original request. Improve accuracy, reliability, completeness, and code quality. Fix any remaining issues.

Do not stop after the first pass. Each pass must build on the previous one. Before finishing, verify that the final result fully satisfies the original request. Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.

Go ahead and create a pull request and then merge the pull request onto the main. Make suggestions for what work still needs to be done and any limitations that is in the way of a successful project. It should be worked on in this next session or the next session. Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.
